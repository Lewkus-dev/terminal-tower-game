# terminal-tower-game
A text-based adventure game set in a castle with common rpg elements such as battle, healing, levels, keys and maybe magic.

There are alot of ways this could turn out. Nothing is certain. As for the game design I have no rigid ideas, I just want to make a fun game entirely in the terminal. 
Later I'd like to animate my own drawings and make silly stupid fun games as a hobby. 

But for now, I just need to learn programming so that I can get a job as a developer.
